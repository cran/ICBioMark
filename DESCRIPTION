Description: Implementation of the methodology proposed in 'Data-driven design of targeted gene panels for estimating immunotherapy biomarkers', Bradley and Cannings (2021) <arXiv:2102.04296>. This package allows the user to fit generative models of mutation from an annotated mutation dataset, and then further to produce tunable linear estimators of exome-wide biomarkers. It also contains functions to simulate mutation annotated format (MAF) data, as well as to analyse the output and performance of models.
